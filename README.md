# Kringle

Kringle is a personal project created by Alec Shunnarah to demo an idea for a social media app that revolves around a gift registry. The MVP version of Kringle is designed to allow users to create a Kringle account using OAuth2 authentication with Google and Facebook, and to allow users to add the gifts they would want to a personal gift registry. The MVP should allow users to add a "wish list" of items they see across the internet, and allow them to export and share that list of gifts seamlessly to other platforms and devices.

## Tech Stack

### Angular

Angular is a front-end framework developed and maintained by Google.

### NodeJS and ExpressJS

NodeJS and ExpressJS are used as the middle-layer to build and call APIs that communicate between the server and the client.

### AWS DynamoDB

Using AWS's DynamoDB to serve as a NoSQL database to store items that a user adds to their gift list. 


## Current Progress

Need to implement Amazon's API or develop my own web scraping function into the application so that users can add Amazon items to their gift registry with just the item's URL.
